This is a react application that scrapes news articles from the New York Times.

You can use this application instead of trying to navigate their site. It's an easier way to hunt down articles.

To start the app locally download the front and backend dependancies. Use the below commands in the terminal and start at the global directory.

yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd..

When both commands are complete run the below command

yarn start

At this point your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
